# Ultrasonic Sensor Parking System with Arduino

This project implements an ultrasonic sensor-based parking system using an Arduino Uno. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance between a vehicle and an obstacle, providing feedback to the driver to aid in parking.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer/LED (for distance alerts)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Features
- Detects distance between the car and an obstacle.
- Alerts via sound or light as the car approaches an obstacle.

## How to Use
1. Connect the components as per the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the provided `parkingsensor.cpp` code to the Arduino.
3. Power the system and test it by moving an object closer to the sensor.

## Files
- `parkingsensor.cpp`: The Arduino code.
- Documentation: Available in both English and Indonesian.
